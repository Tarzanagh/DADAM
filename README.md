# DADAM: A Consensus-based Distributed Adaptive Gradient Method for Online Optimization

# Installation

# 1- Requirement
The algorithms have been implemented in MATLAB and make extensive use of the SGDLibrary. You can find the latest vesion at https://github.com/hiroyuki-kasai/SGDLibrary 


# 2- Setup
Run run_me_first_to_add_libs_.m for path configurations.
You must then make sure that SGDLibrary and the DADAM-master can be seen from MATLAB (i.e. make sure to run addpath on their paths).

# 3- Simplest usage example
Execute example.m for the simplest demonstration of this package. This is the case of softmax_regression problem.


# Reproducing experiments from the paper
To reproduce the experiments, use the folder dadam_tests_real_and_synthetic.
